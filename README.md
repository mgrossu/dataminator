# Data Mining in Python

This repository contains three experiments, each focusing on a different type of data mining problem:

1. **Association Rules**  
2. **Classification**  
3. **Cluster Analysis**

The goal is to compare how various Python libraries handle these types of data mining tasks. The libraries used include **scikit-learn**, **mlxtend**, and **PyCaret**.

## Setup

The experiments are implemented using **Jupyter Notebook** and require Python version **3.8.0**.

Required packages:  
- `notebook`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `mlxtend`  
- `pycaret`  

Install these via pip:  
```bash
pip3 install notebook scikit-learn mlxtend pycaret
```
